Title:  Hey! I'm Max Mendoza
---

Welcome to my personal website! I'm a student at UCLA concurrently working towards a bachelor's in math and computer science and a master's in applied math. I'm passionate about all things machine learning, especially AI safety. I think artificial intelligence has the capacity for immense good, and want to work to make sure we get it right.

## What I Do

For the past year or so, I've been extremely interested in understanding collective intelligence (CI) and how agents coordinate with one another to form "super organisms" that can achieve goals more complex than any of its constituents could on their own. My hope is that developing the mathematical foundations of CI will provide a more principled way to discuss alignment across large networks of interacting agents and perhaps lead to new insights for controlling complex systems. Outside of AI safety, I'm a big foodie and love running, hiking, and any sort of outdoor activity where I'll break a sweat.
