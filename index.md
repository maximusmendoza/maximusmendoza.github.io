Title:  Hey! I'm Max Mendoza
---

Welcome to my personal website! I'm a student at UCLA concurrently working towards a bachelor's in math and computer science and a master's in applied math. I'm passionate about all things machine learning, especially AI safety. I think artificial intelligence has the capacity for immense good, and want to work to make sure we get it right.

## What I Do

My focus lies primarily in mechanistic interpretability, a fascinating area of research that aims to understand how neural networks actually work "under the hood." I'm currently not associated with any labs, but like to post my personal projects here. I also enjoy writing about various aspects of AI. You can get to know my thoughts better through my [blog](/blog).

## Current Project(s)

At any given time, I try to work on a couple projects. Right now, that's:

1. Developing a virtual assistant that makes sure I'm staying productive
2. Implementing Anthropic's "Toy Models of Superposition" from scratch

Hopefully you'll get to see them on my [projects page](/projects) soon.
